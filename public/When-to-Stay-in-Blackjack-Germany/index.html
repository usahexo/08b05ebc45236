        <h1 id="When-to-Stay-in-Blackjack-Germany"><a href="#When-to-Stay-in-Blackjack-Germany" class="headerlink" title="When to Stay in Blackjack Germany"></a>When to Stay in Blackjack Germany</h1><p> has had a tumultuous year, with the rise of the far-right AfD party in parliament, Angela Merkel’s weakened grip on power and the ongoing refugee crisis.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, German blackjack still offers some of the best opportunities in Europe. In this article, we will take a look at when it may be best to stay in Germany and play blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="The-current-political-situation-in-Germany-is-a-little-uncertain"><a href="#The-current-political-situation-in-Germany-is-a-little-uncertain" class="headerlink" title="The current political situation in Germany is a little uncertain"></a>The current political situation in Germany is a little uncertain</h1><p>The current ruling coalition between Merkel’s CDU&#x2F;CSU and the SPD is under pressure, with the AfD now the third-largest party in parliament. There is a chance that this coalition could break up, resulting in new elections. This would be a time when it might be better to avoid Germany, as the political situation could become even more unstable.</p>
<h1 id="The-refugee-crisis-is-ongoing"><a href="#The-refugee-crisis-is-ongoing" class="headerlink" title="The refugee crisis is ongoing"></a>The refugee crisis is ongoing</h1><p>Since 2015, Germany has been struggling with the influx of refugees from Syria and other countries. This has led to divisions within German society and strained relations with other European countries. The refugee crisis is not going away any time soon, so it is best to avoid Germany if you don’t want to get caught up in it.</p>
<h1 id="Other-countries-offer-better-blackjack-opportunities-right-now"><a href="#Other-countries-offer-better-blackjack-opportunities-right-now" class="headerlink" title="Other countries offer better blackjack opportunities right now"></a>Other countries offer better blackjack opportunities right now</h1><p>Germany may be a great place to play blackjack, but there are other countries in Europe that offer even better opportunities right now. Spain and Portugal are both great options, with plenty of casinos offering good games and favourable rules. If you’re looking for somewhere to play blackjack, then these countries are definitely worth considering.</p>
<h1 id="When-to-Strike-in-Blackjack-Germany"><a href="#When-to-Strike-in-Blackjack-Germany" class="headerlink" title="When to Strike in Blackjack Germany"></a>When to Strike in Blackjack Germany</h1><p>The game of blackjack has its origins in France in the early 17th century. It is thought to have been named after a game called “vingt-et-un”, which means twenty-one. This game was played with a standard deck of cards, where the ace was worth 1 point and the other cards were worth their face value. The aim of the game was to draw cards totalling 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If the player drew cards totalling more than 21, they automatically lost the game.</p>
<p>It is likely that blackjack was brought to America by French settlers and quickly became popular throughout the country. In modern times, blackjack is enjoyed by people from all corners of the globe and there are many variations of the game available online and in casino settings.</p>
<p>One such variation is German blackjack, which can be played with either one or two decks of cards. The aim of German blackjack is essentially the same as regular blackjack - to draw cards totalling 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over - but there are a few added rules that make the game more interesting and challenging.</p>
<p>In German blackjack, players are not allowed to hit on totals of 17 or higher. This means that they cannot draw any more cards if their total equals 17 or more; they must stand at this point. Furthermore, if both players have a total of 17 or more (including ties), neither player can win and it is considered a draw.</p>
<p>Additionally, in German blackjack players are not allowed to split pairs (except for two aces). This rule makes the game less strategic and can often lead to some exciting finishes when both players are drawing cards in an attempt to reach 21.</p>
<p>Despite its few differences from regular blackjack, German blackjack is an enjoyable variation of the classic card game that is sure to keep players entertained for hours on end. So if you’re looking for a new gambling challenge while in Germany, why not give German blackjack a try?</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-and-Win-in-Blackjack-Germany"><a href="#How-to-Play-and-Win-in-Blackjack-Germany" class="headerlink" title="How to Play and Win in Blackjack Germany"></a>How to Play and Win in Blackjack Germany</h1><p>In order to win in blackjack while playing in Germany, there are a few things you need to know. The first is the basic rules of the game – when to hit and stand, how to split and double down, and what the different hands mean. Once you know how to play the game, it’s important to understand and use basic blackjack strategy. This will help you make better decisions while playing, which can give you an edge over the casino. Finally, it’s important to find a reputable and trustworthy online casino that offers fair games and good bonuses.</p>
<p>When playing blackjack in Germany, be sure to familiarize yourself with the following basic rules:<br>-You must draw another card if your hand totals less than 16<br>-You must stand on 17 or more<br>-Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what helps your hand the most<br>-A 2 through 10 are worth face value<br>-King, queen and jack are each worth 10 points<br>-If you split a pair of cards with the same value (for example two 8s), you get two new cards and must play them as two separate hands<br>-If you draw a 3rd card on a split ace, it is considered an “11” unless this would put you over 21 (in which case it becomes a “1”) </p>
<p>Once you know the basics of how to play blackjack, it’s time to start using some basic strategy. This involves making decisions based on your hand and the dealer’s up card. For example, if you have a hard 12 facing a 6 (meaning your total equals 18), you should hit rather than stand – even though standing would normally be the better option. By using basic strategy, you can reduce the house edge from around 1.5% down to around 0.5%. </p>

<h1 id="Tips-for-Winning-at-Blackjack-in-Germany"><a href="#Tips-for-Winning-at-Blackjack-in-Germany" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Winning at Blackjack in Germany"></a>Tips for Winning at Blackjack in Germany</h1><p>There are some things you can do to tilt the odds in your favor when playing blackjack in Germany. Here are a few tips to help you win more often:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know the basic rules of blackjack. This may seem like a no-brainer, but many people lose money at blackjack because they don’t understand the basic rules. Make sure you know how to count cards and when to hit or stand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a strategy card. A strategy card can help you make the best decisions for each hand. Most casinos offer these cards for free, so be sure to take advantage of them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play at a reputable casino. Not all casinos are created equal – some have better odds than others. Do your research beforehand and find a casino that has favorable rules for blackjack players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid games with poor odds. There are certain blackjack games that give the player less chance of winning than others. If you want to increase your odds of winning, stick to games with good odds like single deck blackjack or Spanish 21.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slow down your play. When you’re playing at a busy table, it can be tempting to rush through your hands and make bad decisions. However, taking your time and making smart choices is crucial if you want to win at blackjack.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="The-Best-Times-to-Play-Blackjack-in-Germany"><a href="#The-Best-Times-to-Play-Blackjack-in-Germany" class="headerlink" title="The Best Times to Play Blackjack in Germany"></a>The Best Times to Play Blackjack in Germany</h1><p>Unlike in the United States, where blackjack is typically played in casinos, the game of blackjack can also be found at fairgrounds and other locations throughout Germany. In fact, blackjack is such a popular game in Germany that there are specific times of day (or night) when it is best to play.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to maximize your chances of winning while playing blackjack in Germany, then you’ll want to avoid playing during the day. This is because many German players prefer to play during the day, which means the competition is stiffer and the odds are not as favorable. Nighttime, on the other hand, is a great time to play, as there are typically fewer players and the odds are more favorable.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack in Germany is that the rules can vary from location to location. Make sure you familiarize yourself with the specific rules before playing, as there may be different requirements (such as minimum bets or number of decks used) at different venues.</p>
