Some people may enjoy playing slot machines, while others may prefer table games. If you are looking for an exciting and social game to play, you may want to consider playing hand give.</p>
<p>What is hand give? Hand give is a card game that is similar to blackjack. The object of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer or by having a higher score than the dealer. In order to play hand give, you will need at least two players. However, the more players that are involved in the game, the more exciting it becomes.</p>
<p>The cards in hand give are worth their face value with the exception of picture cards, which are worth 10 points each. In order to start the game, each player is dealt two cards face down. The dealer then deals one card face up to themselves and one card face up to each player. The player with the highest card starts the betting round and play passes clockwise around the table.</p>
<p>If you would like to hit, you can ask for another card from the dealer. If your total exceeds 21, you lose automatically and if the total falls below 21, you must decide whether or not to take another card - this is known as standing. When both players have either stood or busted (gone over 21), the dealer reveals their second card and compares their total to that of the players’. The player with the highest total wins - unless they bust in which case the player with the next highest total would win.</p>

So, it’s really important to be aware of the specific rules governing hand usage at the casino you’re playing at, and to always read through them before starting any games.</p>
