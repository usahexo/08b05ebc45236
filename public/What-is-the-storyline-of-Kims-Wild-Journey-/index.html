<h1 id="What-platforms-is-Kims-Wild-Journey-available-on"><a href="#What-platforms-is-Kims-Wild-Journey-available-on" class="headerlink" title="What platforms is Kims Wild Journey available on?"></a>What platforms is Kims Wild Journey available on?</h1><p>Kims Wild Journey is available on the following platforms: </p>
<ul>
<li>Google Play </li>
<li>App Store </li>
<li>Amazon Appstore </li>
<li>Windows Phone Store</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Who-developed-Kims-Wild-Journey"><a href="#Who-developed-Kims-Wild-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Who developed Kims Wild Journey?"></a>Who developed Kims Wild Journey?</h1><p>Kims Wild Journey is a product of two developers, namely Brandon Harris and Justin Chen. These two developers work for a gaming company known as Ludia, which is based in Montreal, Quebec. It was their team that came up with the idea for the game and helped to develop it. </p>
<p>Interestingly, this is not the first time Harris and Chen have teamed up on a project. The two actually met while working on an unannounced game for the Wii U console. This game ended up being cancelled, but it did help to forge a strong relationship between the two developers. </p>
<p>When they were given the opportunity to create their own game, they knew they wanted to do something with dinosaurs. This was because of their love for the Jurassic Park movie franchise, which has spawned several video games over the years. </p>
<p>Chen and Harris started by developing a prototype for the game, which ultimately won them approval from Ludia’s management team. From there, they began working on the full game, which took about 18 months to complete. </p>
<h1 id="Who-else-contributed-to-development"><a href="#Who-else-contributed-to-development" class="headerlink" title="Who else contributed to development?"></a>Who else contributed to development?</h1><p>Aside from Harris and Chen, there were several other people who helped contribute to development of Kims Wild Journey. One such individual was art director Sebastien Croteau, who helped design many of the characters and environments in the game. </p>
<p>Another key contributor was lead programmer Jean-Philippe Baril-Dionne, who helped make sure that all of the different aspects of Kims Wild Journey worked properly together. This was no easy task, as the game features over 1GB of animation data – making it one of Ludia’s most ambitious projects to date. </p>
<p>In addition to these core members of the team, there were also many other people who lent a hand in various ways. This includes QA testers, concept artists, and more. Without all of their hard work, Kims Wild Journey would not be the same great product it is today. </p>
<h1 id="What-inspired-development"><a href="#What-inspired-development" class="headerlink" title="What inspired development?"></a>What inspired development?</h1><p>As mentioned earlier, one key inspiration for development was Jurassic Park – more specifically the movie franchise as a whole.Harris and Chen were both big fans of the movies and were excited to bring some of that excitement into their own video game project. </p>
<p> They weren’t alone in this either; many other members of the team shared this admiration for Jurassic Park (and dinosaurs in general). This helped to fuel their creative process and result in a product that fans of JP would enjoy playing themselves. </p>
<p> Another source if inspiration came from classic platformers like Super Mario Bros., Sonic The Hedgehog 2,, and Rayman Legends,. These games featured intense level designs combined with fast-paced action – something Kims Wild Journeyatics similarly wanted to emulate in their own title</p>
<h1 id="Is-there-a-demo-for-Kims-Wild-Journey"><a href="#Is-there-a-demo-for-Kims-Wild-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Is there a demo for Kims Wild Journey?"></a>Is there a demo for Kims Wild Journey?</h1><p>There is no demo currently available for Kims Wild Journey. However, we are working on one and it will be available soon. In the meantime, you can check out some of our other games.</p>
