#  How to Play Perfect Blackjack and Win Every Time

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world and for good reason – it’s simple to play, but offers plenty of opportunities for strategic decision-making that can give you an edge over the house.

In this article, we’re going to teach you how to play blackjack perfectly so that you can win every time. We’ll start by explaining the basics of the game, before moving on to teaching you how to make the right decisions based on your hand and the dealer’s upcard.

Finally, we’ll give you a few tips on how to manage your bankroll while playing blackjack. Let’s get started!

The Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a relatively simple game to play. The aim is to beat the dealer by achieving a total value of 21 or less, without going bust. Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, while face cards (jacks, queens and kings) are all worth 10 points each. An ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes a better hand.

When you first sit down at a blackjack table, you will be given two cards face up. The dealer will also be given two cards, one face up and one face down (the “hole card”). Your task is to try and beat the dealer’s hand total with your two cards. If your total is higher than the dealer’s, you win!

If your total is 21 or less, but greater than the dealer’s total (including their hole card), then you have achieved “blackjack” and automatically win 1.5 times your bet amount. If your total equals the dealer’s total or if you go bust (ie exceed 21), then you lose your bet amount.

A round of blackjack usually consists of several hands; once all players have had a turn, the dealer will deal another set of two cards to each player and continue around the table in this way until everyone has either busted or gone home with a winning hand. The dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more.

Making Decisions Based on Your Hand and the Dealer’s Upcard

Now that we know the basics of blackjack, let’s move on to learning how to make decisions based on our hand and the dealer’s upcard. As we mentioned earlier, if your hand total is higher than the dealer’s (including their hole card), then you automatically win! So our main goal is simply to draw cards that will help us get as close as possible to 21 without going bust.

If the dealer has an ace showing as their upcard, then they are likely holding a strong hand (an ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 points). In this case, we recommend sticking with conservative plays – ie not taking any further cards in order to avoid going bust. However, if the dealer has a low card such as 2-6 showing, then they are likely weak and it may be worth taking further cards in order to beat them.





















     As we mentioned earlier in this article, an ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 points depending on what makes a better hand. So if we have an ace alongside another low card such as 2-6, we could choose to count our Ace as 11 points in order to form a stronger hand (eg 12+6=18). This would give us more options later in the game when it comes time for us to decide whether or not to hit again.(10 ответов)(10 ответов)

#  Young Gambler Nets $100,000 from Blackjack Game Playing Online

A young gambler, only known as John, has reportedly managed to win over $100,000 from playing blackjack games online. This is an impressive feat, especially considering that the majority of people tend to lose money when gambling.

John is reported to have first started playing blackjack games when he was just eighteen years old. He quickly learned the basics of the game and began to play for real money. In the beginning, he only won small amounts of money but this gradually increased as he became more experienced. Over time, John developed his own winning strategy which enabled him to consistently make profits from blackjack games.

In October 2017, John hit his biggest winning streak ever and managed to win over $100,000 in just two days. He did this by using his winning strategy combined with a fair amount of luck. This windfall has allowed him to quit his job and live off the profits he has made from gambling.

While stories like this are always impressive, it is important to remember that gambling should always be viewed as a form of entertainment rather than a means to make money. It is very rare for people to win big sums of money from gambling and, more often than not, they will end up losing everything they have put in. So if you are looking to make some easy money, then gambling is definitely not the way to go

#  Surprising Twist in Case of Gambling Teenager Accused of Cheating at Blackjack 

On Monday, the 19-year old son of a casino owner was arrested on suspicion of cheating at blackjack. The young man had been playing at the casino for just two hours when he was caught allegedly using a card counting technique to gain an advantage over the house.

However, on Tuesday the story took a surprising turn when the casino owner announced that his son had not been cheating after all - rather, he had simply been lucky enough to have won several hands in a row.

"My son is an excellent blackjack player, but he has never cheated in his life" said the father. "He just got lucky yesterday and I'm glad that he was able to win some money for himself."

The casino owner refused to press charges against his son and the case was eventually dropped. This incident goes to show that even experienced casino players can occasionally have a run of good luck.

#  Nevada Teenager Banned from Casinos After Winning Too Much Money in Blackjack

Nevada teenager Brandon Farquhar has been banned from all casinos in the state after he won too much money while playing blackjack.

The 19-year-old was reportedly gambling at the Silver Legacy Resort Casino in Reno when he started racking up wins. He eventually walked away with over $22,000 in winnings, which caught the attention of casino staff.

After an investigation, it was determined that Farquhar had used a legal loophole to gain an advantage over the casino. As a result, he has been banned from all casinos in Nevada.

Casino officials were quick to point out that Farquhar had not broken any laws, and that his ban was simply a preventative measure to ensure that he does not win any more money at their establishments.

Farquhar says that he is not bitter about being banned, and that he plans to use his winnings to pay for college tuition.
