#  Dealer has edge in blackjack due to natural advantage over player 
A dealer in blackjack has an inherent natural advantage over the player due to their perfect knowledge of the game and the ability to shuffle cards. The dealer also has more information available to them as they see all of the cards played. This gives the dealer a slight edge in the game, which is why betting on the dealer is often recommended by experienced players.

#  Why blackjack dealers have a better chance of winning than players 

The house edge is a term used in gambling to describe the advantage that the casino has over the player. In blackjack, this edge is about 0.5% for players making basic strategy decisions. This means that for every $100 wagered, the casino keeps an average of $0.50. The dealer, on the other hand, has a house edge of just 0.07%, which means they keep an average of only $0.70 for every $100 wagered.

This difference in house edge is what gives dealers a better chance of winning than players at blackjack. It’s important to note, however, that even with this edge, dealers still only have about a 49% chance of winning overall. This is because players can make mistakes that give the casino an even larger edge.

#  Dealer has greater odds of winning because of house edge 

When it comes to casino games, the dealer has a greater chance of winning because of the house edge. This is why many gamblers prefer to stick to table games like blackjack, baccarat and roulette, where the odds are more in their favour.

The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to keep over the long term. It’s built into the game so that the casino can make money regardless of how often players win or lose. For example, in blackjack, the house edge is around 0.5%, which means that for every $100 you wager, the casino expects to keep 50 cents on average.

There are some games where the house edge is even higher – for instance, in keno it can be as high as 25%. This means that for every $100 you wager, you can expect to lose $25 on average. So if you’re looking to increase your chances of winning at casino games, it’s best to stick to table games where the house edge is lower.

#  Dealer's advantage over player comes from deck manipulation 
Deck manipulation is a critical skill for dealers in casino blackjack. It's what gives the dealer an advantage over the player - the ability to control which cards are dealt and when. 

Dealers use deck manipulation to do a few things: 
- To keep track of what cards are left in the deck and make sure they're not dealing themselves too many high cards
- To give themselves the best chance of busting the player when they need to
- To slow down the game by dealing fewer cards per round

In general, the dealer will want to keep track of how many high cards are left in the deck, since these can help them win more hands. They'll also want to save any low cards for later rounds, as these can help them bust the player. 

It's also worth noting that dealers can't always control every card that comes out of the deck. But by using deck manipulation techniques, they can at least put themselves in a better position to take advantage of their hand.

#  Blackjack dealers have better odds due to ability to see cards

When playing blackjack, it is important to understand that the odds are not always in your favor. Blackjack dealers, who can see all of the cards, have a better chance of winning than players.

The house edge in blackjack is around 1%. This means that for every $100 you wager, the casino expects to keep $1 on average. However, there are ways to improve your odds by taking advantage of the dealer’s mistakes.

One way to improve your odds is to double down. When you double down, you are essentially doubling your bet and then receiving one additional card. This gives you a better chance of winning because you are getting more money in play.

Another way to improve your odds is to Split pairs. When you split pairs, you are splitting your original bet into two parts and playing each hand as if it were a separate game. This increases your chances of winning because you now have two chances instead of one to get a good hand.

The key to winning at blackjack is to make smart decisions based on the cards that are dealt. By using these tips, you can tilt the odds in your favor and walk away with some extra cash.
