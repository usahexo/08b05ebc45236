#  Shenandoah Discovery Center to Be Built Next to Movie Casino Bovada

A new Shenandoah Discovery Center is set to be built adjacent to the Movie Casino Bovada in Elizabethtown, PA. The project is a collaboration between the casino and the nonprofit group that runs the nearby Falling Springs waterfall.

The $22 million facility will include a nature center, interactive exhibits, a children's play area, and hiking trails. It will be open year-round, with admission free for members of the casino resort. Construction is expected to begin in late 2019 and be completed by 2021.

The new center will be a major attraction for the area, which is already popular with tourists. The casino resort features a movie theater and restaurants as well as gaming facilities. And the Falling Springs waterfall is among the most popular destinations in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains region.

"This new partnership will create even more excitement and tourism for our region," said state senator John Blake. "It's great news for both our local economy and environmental conservation."

The Shenandoah Discovery Center is a hands-on science museum featuring exhibits on dinosaurs, outer space, and more. It also offers a planetarium and an IMAX theater. The casino features more than 1,000 slot machines and 50 table games.

“We think this will be a great addition for both our businesses,” said Lamb. “Our customers will enjoy the convenience of having both destinations within easy walking distance of each other.”

#  Shenandoah Discovery Center Will Be Close to Casino Bovada

The Shenandoah Discovery Center is Schuylkill County’s top tourist attraction. It has been in operation for over 25 years and features a variety of interactive exhibits about the natural and cultural history of the area.

Last week, the center announced that it will be closing at the end of the year. This was a major blow to the community, which had counted on the center as a key source of tourism revenue.

The reason for the closure is uncertainty surrounding the future of Casino Bovada. The casino is currently in the process of being sold to new owners, and it is not clear what their plans are for the property.

The Discovery Center had been hoping that Casino Bovada would stay open, but with the sale now moving ahead, they have decided to close up shop. This leaves Schuylkill County with one less tourist attraction at a time when they need it most.

#  Construction of Shenandoah Discovery Center Begins Near Casino Bovada

Ground was broken this week on the long-awaited Discovery Center near Casino Bovada, with a planned completion date of late 2020. The center, expected to cost around $100 million, will be a major tourist destination in the region, featuring exhibits on the history and culture of the Shenandoah Valley.

The project has been in the works for more than a decade, but faced several delays due to funding issues. However, recent improvements to the economy have allowed construction to finally get underway. "This is a very exciting day for us," said county executive Warren Geller at the groundbreaking ceremony.

The Discovery Center will be built on a 100-acre plot of land adjacent to Casino Bovada, and will include a museum, theater, and interactive exhibits. It is being funded in part by a $10 million grant from the state government and $20 million in private donations.

Casino Bovada officials are also excited about the project. "This is going to be great for us," said CEO Jerry Silverstein. "We're looking forward to having more visitors coming to our property."

The Discovery Center is expected to create hundreds of jobs in the region and attract millions of tourists each year.

#  Shenandoah Valley's Largest Tourism Attraction Opens Near Casino Bovada

The new Luray Caverns Visitor Center has opened to the public, and is now the largest tourist attraction in the Shenandoah Valley. The $10 million facility includes a new visitors center, gift shop, restaurant, and event space.

Luray Caverns is a natural limestone cave system located near the town of Luray, Virginia. The caverns were discovered in 1878 by two boys who were out hunting rabbits. They found a small hole in the ground that led to a large underground cavern.

The caverns are open to the public year-round, and attract more than half a million visitors each year. The new visitor center will help accommodate the increasing number of tourists and make it easier for them to explore the caverns.

The new visitor center is housed in a large building that features a grand hall with floor-to-ceiling windows. The hall provides spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and the Blue Ridge Mountains.

The visitor center also includes interactive exhibits that teach visitors about the history and geology of Luray Caverns. There is also a gift shop where visitors can purchase souvenirs, and a restaurant where they can eat lunch or dinner.

The event space can accommodate up to 200 people, making it ideal for weddings, conferences, and other special events.
