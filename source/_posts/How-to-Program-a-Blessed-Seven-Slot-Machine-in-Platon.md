# How to Program a Blessed Seven Slot Machine in Platon

In this article, we will be programming a blessed seven slot machine in Platon. The code will be written in Python and is open source.

First, we create the classes for the game. We will have a Game class that manages the game state and a SlotMachine class that represents the actual machine.

class Game: def __init__(self, name, maxBet): self.name = name self.maxBet = maxBet def getName(self): return self.name def bet(self, amount): if self.balance > amount: self.balance -= amount else: print("Insufficient funds") def spin(self): result = random.randint(1, 7) if result == 1: print("You win!") self.balance += 1 elif result == 2: print("You lose :(") self.balance -= 2 elif result == 3: print("Nice win!") self.balance += 5 elif result == 4: print("You lose :(") self.balance -= 10 elif result == 5: print("You win!") self.balance += 25 elif result == 6: print("You lose :(") self.balance -= 50 else: print("Invalid spin") def getBalance(self): return self.balance


The SlotMachine class has methods to simulate a spin of the machine and returns a random number between 1 and 7 corresponding to the outcome of the spin.

class SlotMachine(): def __init__(self, name, symbols, maxBet): self .name = name self .symbols = symbols self .maxBet = maxBet def simulateSpin(self): results = [] for symbol in self .symbols : results .append((random .randint (0, 9))) return results

Now that we have our classes defined, we can write the code to main() which sets up the game and starts playing! We first create an instance of our Game class and give it a name and maximum bet amount.

game = Game('blessed7', 100)

Next, we create an instance of our SlotMachine class and set its name and symbols.

slotMachine = SlotMachine('lucky7', ['7', 'bar', 'double bar', 'triple bar'], 100)

We also need to keep track of how much money the player has bet so far throughout the game. We initialize this value to 0 at the beginning of the game.

playerBettableAmount = 0

Now let's write the code to play! We start by looping until the player either wins or loses their entire balance as determined by our getBalance() method from our Game class). In each iteration of the loop, we check if the player has any money left to bet by comparing their current balance with playerBettableAmount . If they do have money left to bet, we then ask them how much they want to wager and update playerBettableAmount accordingly (remembering to keep track of their total bet). Once the player has either run out of money or decided not to bet any more, we simulates a spin on our slot machine and update our game state accordingly based on the outcome of the spin (either increasing or decreasing the player's balance). Here is all of the code together in one place!

def main(): game = Game('blessed7', 100) slotMachine = SlotMachine('lucky7', ['7', 'bar', 'double bar', 'triple bar'], 100) playerBettableAmount = 0 while True : results = slotMachine .simulateSpin() balance = game .getBalance() newBalance = balance if results[0] <= 3 : # Lose half what was betted minus one newBalance -= (playerBettableAmount * 0.5) - 1 elif results[0] >= 4 : # Win two hundred fifty percent what was betted plus one newBalance += (playerBettableAmount * 2.5) + 1 else : # Do something else with other results print (results ) if balance <= 0 : break; amountTo Bet = input ('How much would you like to bet?:') if amountToBet != None : playerBettableAmount += amountToBet else : print ('No more bets please.') main()
