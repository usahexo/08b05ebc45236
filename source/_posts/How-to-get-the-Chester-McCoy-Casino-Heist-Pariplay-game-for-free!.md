## The basics

The game is based on the famous casino heist by American criminal Chester McCoy in 1978. In the game, you play as Chester himself as you attempt to rob the casino and make your escape. Along the way, you must avoid the security guards, gather the money and make your escape.

The game is a five-reel slot machine with 20 paylines. You can bet between 1 and 10 coins on each line, making a maximum bet of 200 coins. The minimum coin size is 0.01 and the maximum coin size is 2.00. So, for a $1 bet you would need to wager 40 coins per spin.

There are six basic symbols in the game: diamonds, dollar signs, gold bars, cheques, roses and Cadillac cars. The diamonds are the highest paying symbol and three or more will pay out up to 400x your bet amount. The second highest payout is for three or more dollar signs which will pay out up to 300x your bet amount. Other symbols pay out between 120x and 60x your bet amount depending on how many appear on the reels.

The wild symbol is represented by McCoy himself and can substitute for any other symbol except the scatter symbol to help form winning combinations. If McCoy forms part of a winning combination, he will double the payout amount.

The scatter symbol is represented by a safe and if three or more appear anywhere on the reels, you will trigger the bonus round where you can win up to 100x your total bet amount.

## How to play

To play, select your coin size and then choose how many coins you want to wager on each line using the ‘+’ and ‘-’ buttons next to Lines Bet field.
