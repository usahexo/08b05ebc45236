#  Vermont Introduces First Legal Online Bingo Casino

In what is seen as a watershed moment for the state of Vermont, lawmakers have just introduced a bill that would legalize and regulate online bingo casinos.

The proposed bill, S.269, was introduced by Senators Jane Kitchel and Bobby Starr on January 9th and has been referred to the Committee on General, Housing and Military Affairs.

If it passes, the bill would allow Vermonters aged 21 or older to play online bingo at licensed casinos within the state. The casinos would be subject to strict regulation and would be required to pay taxes on their revenues.

Senator Kitchel believes that legalizing online bingo will help to boost Vermont's economy: "This is an opportunity for Vermont to generate new jobs and revenue from a new industry. I'm confident that we can craft a bill that will protect consumers while allowing Vermonters to enjoy this fun and exciting game".

Governor Phil Scott echoed these sentiments, stating that he was "open to considering any proposal that could create jobs and grow our economy".

If passed, the bill would make Vermont the first state in the country to legalize online bingo casino gambling. This could lead to other states following suit, as there is growing interest in this type of gambling across the country.

#  Jersey Closes Border To Vermont; Online Bingo Suffers

The small state of Jersey has closed its borders to the much larger state of Vermont in a move that is sure to cause economic problems for the online bingo industry in the two states.

The decision to close the border was made by the Jersey government in response to what it says is an influx of Vermont residents crossing into Jersey in order to take advantage of its more generous social welfare programs.

"We can no longer allow our resources to be drained by Vermonters looking for a free ride," said a spokesperson for the Jersey government. "Closing the border is a necessary step to protect our taxpayers."

The move has infuriated officials in Vermont, who accuse Jersey of engaging in "xenophobia" and say that the closure of the border will have a negative impact on both states.

"This is nothing more than a petty power play by Jersey," said a spokesperson for the Vermont government. "They are punishing us because we have chosen to provide our citizens with a better quality of life."

The closure of the border has already had a negative impact on businesses in both states, with many people unable to travel between them. The online bingo industry is likely to be one of the hardest hit, as players in both states use the websites to play against each other.

#  Vermont's Online Casino Booms, Despite Closure Of Border

The closure of the Vermont-Canada border has not stopped the growth of the state's online casino industry.

"Even without people being able to cross the border and gamble in Canada, our online casino is still doing really well," said Jeremy Smith, marketing director for the state's Division of Gaming.

As laws have tightened at the border, many Vermonters have turned to online casinos to get their gaming fix. In fact, Mr. Smith estimates that over 60% of the state's online casino traffic now comes from Vermont residents.

This continued success is despite recent efforts by Canadian lawmakers to crack down on online gambling within their own country. In April, the Canadian Senate passed a bill that would make it illegal for citizens to gamble on unlicensed offshore websites. This bill is now awaiting approval from the House of Commons.

While this new law may hurt Canadian online casinos, it is not expected to have a significant impact on Vermont's industry. "There are plenty of other offshore sites that Vermonters can use," said Mr. Smith. "And even if some people do switch over to those sites, that just means more business for us."

The growth of Vermont's online casino industry is good news for the state's budget. The Division of Gaming expects to bring in over $4 million in revenue this year, up from $2 million last year.

#  Is Vermont The Next Nevada In Regard To Gambling?

Gambling is becoming a more popular form of entertainment, and lawmakers are taking notice. This has led to a number of states legalizing various forms of gambling in recent years. In some cases, this move has proven to be lucrative for the state, as in the case of Nevada. Vermont may be looking to emulate Nevada’s success by legalizing gambling in the near future.

There are a few types of gambling that could be legalized in Vermont. These include online gambling, casino gambling, and sports betting. There is already some form of legalized gambling in the state, as there are two racinos operating in Vermont. However, these racinos only offer limited types of gambling.

Online gambling is particularly intriguing option for Vermont legislators. This is because it could be offered without the need for any physical infrastructure, such as casinos or sportsbooks. Additionally, online gambling could generate considerable revenue for the state. In fact, it’s estimated that the global online gambling market will be worth $52 billion by 2020.

Interestingly, one of the biggest barriers to online gambling legalization is public opinion. A poll conducted by Morning Consult found that 55% of Vermonters oppose legalizing online gambling. However, this opposition appears to be softening over time, as only 49% of Vermonters opposed legalization in a poll from 2016.

If Vermont does legalize online gambling, it will join a growing list of states that have done so. These states include New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and West Virginia.
