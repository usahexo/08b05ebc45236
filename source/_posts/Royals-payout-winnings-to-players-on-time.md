#  Royals payout winnings to players on time

In a gesture of good will, the Kansas City Royals today announced that they would be issuing player payments for the month of April on time. The move comes as a relief to players and staff alike, many of whom were facing difficult personal choices had their paychecks been delayed.

“This team has gone through a lot of tough times together,” said infielder Whit Merrifield in a statement. “It’s great to see the organization stepping up and doing what’s right by us.”

The Royals front office has remained largely silent on the issue of player pay throughout the season, with rumors swirling that the team was having trouble meeting its financial obligations. The decision to issue paychecks on time is seen as a sign that the team is looking to put its recent struggles behind it and focus on returning to contention in 2020.

Players and staff are hopeful that this is just the beginning of a new era for the Royals. As outfielder Alex Gordon put it: “We all know that things haven’t been going well lately, but this shows that the club is still committed to us. We’re going to do everything we can to bounce back and make them proud.”

#  Player wins big payout from Royals casino

Kansas City, MO - A lucky player at the Royals casino in Kansas City walked away with a big payout over the weekend. The player, who wished to remain anonymous, won a total of $92,000 playing one of the casino's slot machines.

"I couldn't believe it when I hit the jackpot," said the winner. "It was just my luck that I happened to be playing that machine when it paid out."

The Royals casino is a popular destination for gambling enthusiasts in Missouri. The casino has a wide variety of slot machines and table games, as well as a top-notch steakhouse and luxury hotel.

"We're really happy for our lucky winner," said casino spokesperson Linda Wilson. "This is the kind of story that makes our guests feel like they can win big too."

In addition to the $92,000 jackpot, the player also won another $2,000 on other slots over the course of their visit.

#  Royals announce new payment options for players

The Royals today announced a new payment plan for players, which will allow them to be paid in installments throughout the season.

"We're excited about this new plan, which will help our players manage their finances and give them more certainty about their income," said Royals GM Dayton Moore. "It's another step in our efforts to build a first-class organization."

The new payment plan will be available to all players on the major league roster, as well as those on the 40-man roster. Players will have the option of being paid in eight or twelve monthly installments, and the club will withhold 25 percent of each player's salary until the end of the season.

"This is a great opportunity for our players," said catcher Salvador Perez. "It gives us peace of mind knowing that we'll get paid throughout the season, and it helps us budget our money better."

The new payment plan is also expected to help attract free agents to Kansas City.

"Players want to know that they're going to be taken care of financially, and this new plan sends a clear message that the Royals are committed to doing just that," said agent Scott Boras. "It's another reason why Kansas City should be high on every free agent's list."
