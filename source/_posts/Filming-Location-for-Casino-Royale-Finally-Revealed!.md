#  Filming Location for Casino Royale Finally Revealed!

007 fans around the world have been eagerly awaiting news on the filming location for Casino Royale, and speculation has been running rampant. But now, the producers of the movie have finally announced that they will be filming in Prague!

Prague is an ideal location for Daniel Craig's first outing as James Bond. It is home to beautiful architecture and stunning scenery that will look perfect on the big screen. In addition, Prague is a very cost effective place to shoot a movie, which is sure to please the filmmakers' bottom line.

The Czech government has been working hard to promote Prague as a film destination, and it seems to be paying off. In recent years, Prague has hosted productions such as X-Men: First Class and The Bourne Legacy. The city is quickly becoming known as a go-to spot for Hollywood blockbusters.

Casino Royale is scheduled to start filming in early November, so 007 fans can start counting down the days until they see their favorite superspy on the big screen again!

#  Shooting for Casino Royale Wraps in Atlantic City

MGM has announced that production on "Casino Royale" wrapped up last weekend in Atlantic City. The movie, which is a remake of the 1967 classic and the first installment of the James Bond series, stars Daniel Craig as Agent 007.

Atlantic City was chosen as a filming location because of its long history with gambling and its diverse architecture. "Casino Royale" features scenes shot in several well-known Atlantic City casinos, including the Borgata, Harrah's, Trump Taj Mahal and Tropicana.

In addition to Atlantic City, other locations used in the film include London, Prague and Venice. The movie is scheduled for release on November 17th.

#  Sneak Peek of 'Casino Royale' – Filmed in Atlantic City

Atlantic City is in the spotlight once again as the filming location for the new James Bond movie, "Casino Royale." The cast and crew descended on the city this week to begin shooting the latest installment of the 007 franchise.

This isn't the first time that Atlantic City has been featured in a Bond movie – Martin Campbell's "Casino Royale" (2006), which was also filmed in Atlantic City, featured a cameo by none other than New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

While it's unclear how much of the movie will be filmed in Atlantic City, local officials are hoping that the city will get some good exposure from being associated with one of Hollywood's biggest franchises.

"We're excited to have James Bond back in Atlantic City," said Casino Reinvestment Development Authority Deputy Executive Director John Palmieri. "The last time he was here, we saw a significant uptick in tourism. We expect this time to be even bigger."

Filming is expected to continue through early November, with a planned release date of November 17th.

#  Behind the Scenes of 'Casino Royale' – Filmed in Atlantic City 

When it was announced that "Casino Royale" was being filmed in Atlantic City, there was much speculation as to which casino would be used as the backdrop for the movie. The producers had a difficult time deciding, but in the end they chose the Borgata.

The decision paid off, as the Borgata became one of the stars of the movie. In fact, some scenes were actually shot inside the casino.

Of course, not everything went smoothly. One scene required actress Eva Green to jump into a canal in Venice. Unfortunately, the water was a lot colder than she anticipated, and she ended up getting sick afterwards.

Although it only lasted two weeks, filming in Atlantic City created a lot of excitement in the city. Some businesses saw a boost in sales, while others took advantage of the opportunity to market themselves to tourists who were in town for the movie.

Overall, "Casino Royale" was good for Atlantic City and helped to showcase its potential as a tourist destination.
