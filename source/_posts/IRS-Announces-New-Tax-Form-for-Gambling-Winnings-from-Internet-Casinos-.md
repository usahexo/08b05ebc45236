#  IRS Announces New Tax Form for Gambling Winnings from Internet Casinos 

On October 16, the IRS released a new Form 1040, Schedule 1 entitled "Gambling Winnings" specifically for gambling winnings from internet casinos. A copy of the new form can be seen below.

The new schedule is in addition to the already existing Schedule W, which is used to report gambling winnings and losses from all other types of gambling activities. gambling income from casino games, lotteries, raffles, horse racing, and other types of wagering or betting.

The IRS has long considered gamblers to be taxpayers on the lookout for tax evasion, and this new schedule is just another way that the agency is trying to ensure that all gambling income is reported. The new form will help the IRS track down taxpayers who may be hiding their internet casino winnings from the government.

The Form 1040, Schedule 1 "Gambling Winnings" is six pages long and requests a great deal of information about each instance of gambling income. The taxpayer is required to provide the date of the win, the amount won, the type of game played, and the name and address of the internet casino where the income was generated.

Taxpayers are also asked to provide their social security number and complete a detailed description of their gambling activity. This includes specifying whether they were betting against the house (casino), playing against other players (poker), or playing slot machines or other games where chance predominates over skill (bingo).

The new form will make it easier for the IRS to identify internet gamblers who have failed to report their gambling income. If you have won money from an internet casino in 2018, it is important to report this income on your tax return using Form 1040, Schedule 1 "Gambling Winnings."

#  You May Have to File a New Tax Form If You Won Money from an Online Casino 

Las Vegas is a well-known city for gambling. In recent years, however, online casinos have become an increasingly popular way to gamble. What many people may not know is that if you win money from an online casino, you may have to file a new tax form.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires taxpayers who receive certain types of income to report it on a new tax form, the 1099-MISC. Income that must be reported on this form includes gambling winnings, rental income, and self-employment income.

In most cases, taxpayers only need to report their gambling winnings if the amount they won is more than $600. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if you win money in a foreign country or in connection with a wager on a horse race, dog race, or other sporting event, you may be required to report all of your winnings on the 1099-MISC.

Gambling income is considered taxable income and must be included in your tax return. You will typically need to pay taxes on your winnings at the same rate as your regular income. However, you may be able to claim a deduction for gambling losses if you itemize deductions on your tax return.

If you have won money from an online casino, it is important to report the winnings on the 1099-MISC and include them in your tax return. Failure to do so can result in penalties from the IRS.

#  Get Ready to File a New Tax Form if You Won Money from an Online Casino 

If you are like millions of other Americans, you spent some time playing casino games online in the hope of winning big. And if you were lucky enough to hit it big, you may be wondering what the tax requirements are for your winnings. Here is a guide to help you understand what you need to do when it comes time to file your taxes.

Generally speaking, gambling winnings are taxable and you will need to report them on your tax return. The good news is that you can usually claim gambling losses as a deduction, which can help offset any taxes you may owe on your winnings.

You will need to report your winnings on IRS Form 1040, Schedule A, as miscellaneous income. This applies whether your winnings are from an online casino or from any other type of gambling activity. In order to calculate how much tax you owe on your gambling income, you will need to determine your “gross income” from gambling. This is calculated by subtracting your gambling losses from your gambling winnings.

For example, if you won $1,000 in casino games online but also lost $600 in other bets, your gross income from gambling would be $400 ($1,000 – $600). If your taxable income for the year was $30,000, then the $400 in gambling income would be taxed at 15%, or $60 ($400 x 15%).

There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to reporting gambling income and expenses. First of all, only wins and losses related to gambling activities can be claimed as deductions. So if you had a winning day at the races but also lost money at the casino that night, only the race track losses can be deducted. In addition, if you receive a Form W-2G from a casino or other gaming establishment showing the amount of your winnings (and withholding), that amount must be included in your gross income even if you don’t receive the form until after the tax deadline has passed.

There are also some special rules that apply to slot machines and bingo. Generally speaking, slot machine winnings (including those earned online) are subject to a 25% withholding tax by the gaming establishment. However, this withholding tax can be reduced or waived if it can be shown that the taxpayer resides outside of the United States. For bingo winnings, only prizes above certain thresholds must be reported on Form 1040; any prizes below this threshold don’t need to be reported.

Taxes on gambling income can seem confusing at first glance, but with a little knowledge and some basic recordkeeping it’s not too difficult to stay compliant. As long as you report all of your taxable income on your return and take any allowable deductions related to gambling losses, there shouldn’t be any surprises come Tax Day.

#  Are You Ready to File a New Tax Form for Gambling Winnings from an Internet Casino? 

The IRS requires taxpayers to report all gambling winnings, whether they’re from a state or local lottery, horse racing, casinos or the internet. You must include the amount of your winnings on your tax return as income and file a Form 1040.

You don’t need to worry about reporting gambling losses. The cost of your losses may be deductible, but only up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you win $1,000 in a casino and lose $500 at the tables, you can only deduct the $500 in losses on your tax return.

Some taxpayers think they can avoid paying taxes on their gambling winnings by not reporting them. But that’s not how it works. You must report all of your gambling income, even if you don’t receive a Form W2-G from the casino. And remember, if you use ripped-off casino chips or play poker with friends and don’t cash out your winnings, those earnings are still taxable income.

There are a few exceptions to the rule that all gambling income is taxable. Gambling income won through Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments is not taxable. Additionally, any gambling losses incurred while participating in an illegal activity are not deductible on your tax return.

#  Filming Your Gambling Winnings: The New IRS Tax Form

It’s been just a few weeks since the IRS released the new Form 1040 and its supplemental schedules. And, as expected, filers are already finding new ways to use them to their advantage.

The most recent development? Taxpayers are now using the new Form 1040 to film their gambling winnings in order to minimize their tax liability.

Here’s how it works: by reporting their gambling winnings on Schedule A (Itemized Deductions), taxpayers can offset those winnings with standard deductions and thereby reduce their taxable income.

And, if they incur any losses while gambling, they can report those on Schedule A as well. This will help to further reduce their taxable income – and their overall tax liability.

But there’s a catch: in order to take advantage of this strategy, you must absolutely itemize your deductions on Form 1040. This means that if you choose the standard deduction instead, you won’t be able to claim your gambling losses.

So is it worth it? That depends on your individual situation. But if you do have significant gambling losses, filming them could save you a lot of money come tax time.
