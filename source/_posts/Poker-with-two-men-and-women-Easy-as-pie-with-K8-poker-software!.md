#  Poker with two men and women? Easy as pie with K8 poker software!

Poker is one of the most popular card games in the world. In a deck of 52 cards, there are multiple combinations that can be made, so poker always remains a fresh and exciting game. The popularity of online poker has only increased its following, with people from all over the globe enjoying a friendly or frenzied game of internet poker.

There are many different variations of the game, but for the beginner it might be helpful to understand the basics before delving into the different types of poker. There are generally two main types of poker – draw poker and stud poker. In draw poker, players are dealt five cards each, and then have an opportunity to replace any number of those cards before betting begins. In stud poker, players are dealt seven cards each, with some being face up and some face down. The player must use exactly three of their seven cards to make their best hand, with the other four being used as ‘community’ cards shared by all players.

Now that we know a bit more about the two main types of poker, let’s move on to playing with two men and two women!
